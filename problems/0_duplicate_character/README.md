Create a function that can tell if there is a duplicate character in a string.

Example:
"tyler" would output `false`
"tylertracy" would output `true`

There are two files included in this folder that you can use to test.
`input.txt` contains a bunch of lines of inputs
`output.txt` contains the corresponding output to the input in the `input.txt` file
