Create a function to tell if a string is a palindrome

Example:
- `"tyler" -> false`
- `"tylerelyt" -> true`
- `"123321" -> true`
- `"123421" -> false`

There are two files included in this folder that you can use to test. \
`input.txt` contains a bunch of lines of inputs \
`output.txt` contains the output corresponding to the input in the `input.txt` file
