To get the code on github to your computer so you can play around with it you have to _clone_ the repo.

If you haven't already, you need to make a github account. Share your username with me on the slack and I'll add you to the repository.

Now you are going to need to install **git**. Click [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads) to go to the download link.

Now to actually use git from the command line, you'll have to add it to your path. Your path is a list of folders on your computer that is checks for commands.

After you do this you should be able to go to your command prompt (cmd for windows, and terminal for mac) and type git and press enter. It should give a big list of commands. Now git is on your computer.

Before we clone the repository, you should consider where on your computer you are going to put the code. You will normally be navigating to this code from the command line so somewhere simple is nice. I just have a folder on my root called Coding and whenever I clone a repository, I put it there. That way all of my code is in one place that is easy to find.

Now to actually clone the repository, you are going to need to go to the repository's website and click "Clone or download" and make sure it says "Clone with https" then copy that link. Navigate to where you want to put the code on your terminal and then type `git clone <your url>` (Replace \<your url\> with the url you copied). Then it should all be done!
